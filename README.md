The jumping off point for exploring quantum computing is to understand that while many of the principles are counterintuitive, the classical universe we know and love is but a mere shadow of the quantum fabric of reality. To get a feel for that fundamental difference we will walk through an example that helps to illustrate the power of quantum computation

https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/
```
Common uses for a reverse proxy server include:

    Load balancing – A reverse proxy server can act as a “traffic cop,” sitting in front of your backend servers and distributing client requests across a group of servers in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization while ensuring no one server is overloaded, which can degrade performance. If a server goes down, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online servers.
    Web acceleration – Reverse proxies can compress inbound and outbound data, as well as cache commonly requested content, both of which speed up the flow of traffic between clients and servers. They can also perform additional tasks such as SSL encryption to take load off of your web servers, thereby boosting their performance.
    Security and anonymity – By intercepting requests headed for your backend servers, a reverse proxy server protects their identities and acts as an additional defense against security attacks. It also ensures that multiple servers can be accessed from a single record locator or URL regardless of the structure of your local area network.

```
Data sharding is a solution for business applications with large data sets and scale needs. There are a variety of sharding architectures to choose from, each of which provides different capabilities. Before settling on a sharding architecture, the needs and workload requirements of your application must be mapped out. Manual sharding should be avoided in most circumstances given significant increase in application logic complexity. YugabyteDB is an auto-sharded distributed SQL database with support for both hash and range sharding today. Support for geo-partitioning is coming soon. In this tutorial, you can see YugabyteDB’s automatic sharding in action.

https://blog.tailwindcss.com/just-in-time-the-next-generation-of-tailwind-css
```
@tailwindcss/jit
is a new experimental library that compiles all of your CSS on-demand as you author your template files, instead of generating your entire stylesheet up front.

This comes with a lot of advantages:

Lightning fast build times. Tailwind can take 3–8s to initially compile using our CLI, and upwards of 30–45s in webpack projects because webpack struggles with large CSS files. This library can compile even the biggest projects in about 800ms (with incremental rebuilds as fast as 3ms), no matter what build tool you're using.
Every variant is enabled out of the box. Variants like focus-visible, active, disabled, and others are not normally enabled by default due to file-size considerations. Since this library generates styles on demand, you can use any variant you want, whenever you want. You can even stack them like sm:hover:active:disabled:opacity-75. Never configure your variants again.
Generate arbitrary styles without writing custom CSS. Ever needed some ultra-specific value that wasn't part of your design system, like top: -113px for a quirky background image? Since styles are generated on demand, you can just generate a utility for this as needed using square bracket notation like top-[-113px]. Works with variants too, like md:top-[-113px].
Your CSS is identical in development and production. Since styles are generated as they are needed, you don't need to purge unused styles for production, which means you see the exact same CSS in all environments. Never worry about accidentally purging an important style in production again.
Better browser performance in development. Since development builds are as small as production builds, the browser doesn't have to parse and manage multiple megabytes of pre-generated CSS. In projects with heavily extended configurations this makes dev tools a lot more responsive.

What is a blockchain?

Digital currencies are one of the first global use cases for blockchain technology. Because they are used by many large payment service providers and e-commerce companies, cryptocurrencies have become mainstream. But what is the underlying blockchain technology and why does it ultimately have little to do with digital currencies?

The blockchain is an unchangeable, democratic, and transparent storage method for data (database). This is how you can describe this technology in one sentence. But where does the unchangeable, democratic and transparent come from? We get to the bottom of the matter:

```
Elixir is a programming language written almost completely in Elixir itself. That is because it runs on the BEAM (Erlang virtual machine), and only parts of it were written in the Erlang programming language - the rest of it was written in Elixir. At this time of writing, according to the Elixir language's repository (github.com/elixir-lang/elixir), 91.8% of Elixir is written in Elixir.

Why is it important?
✅ Clarify the right use of your app
✅ Show all the features
✅ Gives you exposure
✅ Your app will be taken seriously (what about if you scale?)
✅ Maybe the app is not too intuitive as you think
