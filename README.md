This is an example of using sharding in yugabyteDB

```
Data sharding is a solution for business applications with large data sets and scale needs. There are a variety of sharding architectures to choose from, each of which provides different capabilities. Before settling on a sharding architecture, the needs and workload requirements of your application must be mapped out. Manual sharding should be avoided in most circumstances given significant increase in application logic complexity. YugabyteDB is an auto-sharded distributed SQL database with support for both hash and range sharding today. Support for geo-partitioning is coming soon. In this tutorial, you can see YugabyteDB’s automatic sharding in action.

```
@tailwindcss/jit
is a new experimental library that compiles all of your CSS on-demand as you author your template files, instead of generating your entire stylesheet up front.

This comes with a lot of advantages:

Lightning fast build times. Tailwind can take 3–8s to initially compile using our CLI, and upwards of 30–45s in webpack projects because webpack struggles with large CSS files. This library can compile even the biggest projects in about 800ms (with incremental rebuilds as fast as 3ms), no matter what build tool you're using.
Every variant is enabled out of the box. Variants like focus-visible, active, disabled, and others are not normally enabled by default due to file-size considerations. Since this library generates styles on demand, you can use any variant you want, whenever you want. You can even stack them like sm:hover:active:disabled:opacity-75. Never configure your variants again.
Generate arbitrary styles without writing custom CSS. Ever needed some ultra-specific value that wasn't part of your design system, like top: -113px for a quirky background image? Since styles are generated on demand, you can just generate a utility for this as needed using square bracket notation like top-[-113px]. Works with variants too, like md:top-[-113px].
Your CSS is identical in development and production. Since styles are generated as they are needed, you don't need to purge unused styles for production, which means you see the exact same CSS in all environments. Never worry about accidentally purging an important style in production again.
Better browser performance in development. Since development builds are as small as production builds, the browser doesn't have to parse and manage multiple megabytes of pre-generated CSS. In projects with heavily extended configurations this makes dev tools a lot more responsive.

A pair of pioneering computer scientists — who met at Princeton University and forged their friendship at the legendary Bell Labs in New Jersey — were named the winners of the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for computing Wednesday for helping revolutionize how the world interacts with computers.

Alfred Vaino Aho, now a professor emeritus at Columbia University, and Jeffrey David Ullman, a professor emeritus at Stanford University, were named the recipients of the A.M. Turing Award for their lifetime of work

What is a blockchain?

Digital currencies are one of the first global use cases for blockchain technology. Because they are used by many large payment service providers and e-commerce companies, cryptocurrencies have become mainstream. But what is the underlying blockchain technology and why does it ultimately have little to do with digital currencies?

The blockchain is an unchangeable, democratic, and transparent storage method for data (database). This is how you can describe this technology in one sentence. But where does the unchangeable, democratic and transparent come from? We get to the bottom of the matter:

```
Elixir is a programming language written almost completely in Elixir itself. That is because it runs on the BEAM (Erlang virtual machine), and only parts of it were written in the Erlang programming language - the rest of it was written in Elixir. At this time of writing, according to the Elixir language's repository (github.com/elixir-lang/elixir), 91.8% of Elixir is written in Elixir.

Why is it important?
✅ Clarify the right use of your app
✅ Show all the features
✅ Gives you exposure
✅ Your app will be taken seriously (what about if you scale?)
✅ Maybe the app is not too intuitive as you think
